Weather Station
================

A weather station based on **[Open Weather Map JSON API](http://openweathermap.org/API)**

## My ToDo

### * Must :star:

- [x] Generate new API key on http://openweathermap.org/API
- [x] Home page: Accept city and country
- [ ] Validate City/Country: city and country both required
- [ ] Table to show data
- [ ] Submiting form should show me weather
- [ ] Temperature
- [ ] Wind
- [ ] Cloudiness
- [ ] Pressure
- [ ] Humidity
- [ ] Sunrise
- [ ] Sunset
- [ ] Geo coords
- [ ] Show recent search (persist this info in db?)

### Good :sparkles:
- [ ] Show weather forecast(next hour, next 24hr)
- [ ] Auto load cities per country
- [ ] Auto-complete for city and country
- [ ] Integrate weather widget

###  WoW :heart:
- [ ] Graphical representation of weather
- [ ] Search by city: using search engine(Sphinx, Solr)
- [ ] Show weather forecast(weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Change background/theme based on weather conditions(Raining :umbrella:, Cloudy :cloud:, Sunny :sunny:, Snow-fall :snowflake: like that)
